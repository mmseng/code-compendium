# Matt's code compendium

## Me
I've been an IT Pro for higher education since 2007. This is a list of some projects I've done, mostly Powershell-based.  

My Github.com username is mmseng, but the majority of my scripting work is done for the purposes of system administration in my work for Engineering IT Shared Services, in the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois, where my NetID is mseng3.  

If you wish to contact me about my work, please use the University's Microsoft Teams system to do so. If you can't, then email to my university email will suffice. For now, I will not monitor communications here on GitHub.  

## Access
Currently much of my work is stored on version control systems internal to the college, though eventually it will be slowly migrated to the university's GitHub.com organizations, which is why I've spun up this page/repo, and I'll try to keep it updated with the current locations of my projects.  

If you do not already have access to a project linked below and are interested in getting access, please contact me per the above. Some projects are already public, some are not, so try the links first. For projects hosted on gitlab.engr-illinois.edu, you must sign in there at least once, so that your account will be generated and can be granted access.

## Compendium
The following is a list of the major scripts/modules/projects I've made, roughly organized by their current location and purpose.

## Generalized topics which I have at least some experience with, but which don't represent specific code projects
- Misc gathering, reporting, and manipulation of AD, MECM, LENS, and IPAM data
- Using custom GUI input prompts and logic at the beginning of an MECM task sequence
- Kicking off custom scripts after an MECM task sequence has finished and rebooted, to do things that cannot be done during a TS
- Automation of AMT commands to endpoints via Intel's IntelvPro Powershell module
- Quick functions for various handy, quick and dirty administrative tasks
- Customization of Powershell profile, with automatic import of various modules, such as those mentioned above
- General practice of thorough process logging for scripts for easy troubleshooting and review

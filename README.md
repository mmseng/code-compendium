# Matt's code compendium

### Me
My name is Matt Seng. I've been an IT Pro for higher education since 2007. This is a list of projects I've done, mostly Powershell-based.  

My Github.com username is mmseng, but the majority of my scripting work is done for the purposes of system administration for the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois, where my NetID is mseng3.  

If you wish to contact me about my work, please use the University's Microsoft Teams system to do so. If you can't, then email to my university email will suffice. For now, I will not monitor communications here on GitHub.  

### Access
Currently much of my work is stored on version control systems internal to the college, though eventually it will be slowly migrated to the university's GitHub.com organizations, which is why I've spun up this page/repo, and I'll try to keep it updated with the current locations of my projects.  

If you do not have access to a project linked below and are interested in getting access, please contact me per the above.  

### Compendium
The following is a list of the major scripts/modules/projects I've made, roughly organized by their current location and purpose.
